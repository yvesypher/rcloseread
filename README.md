I first started using R in my second year of university. It was a unit that mostly focused on how to use different package functions for data analysis. Back then, I didn’t know much about R beyond the basics, and I missed out on just how interesting and powerful it really is. Working on this scrollytelling project completely changed my perspective. I realized how exciting R can be, and it made me want to share that excitement with others. This [blog](https://yvesypher.quarto.pub/rucurious/) is for people like my second-year self—just starting out—hoping it inspires them to explore R with curiosity and enthusiasm.
